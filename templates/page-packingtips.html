Using <b>packing cubes</b> helps keep everything neat and easy to find. Choosing <b>neutral, mix-and-match clothing</b> creates more outfit options with fewer items.\n\nToiletries should stay <b>small and TSA-compliant</b>, and including a <b>mini first-aid kit</b> is always a good idea. Most importantly, travelers should always keep essentials: passport, power bank, chargers, travel documents, and a spare outfit in the <b>carry-on</b>.\n\nAnd here’s a pro move: always <b>leave a little extra space</b> in the bag. It’s perfect for souvenirs, snacks, or that cute local find no one saw coming.\n\nThis guide offers curated insights, checklists, and proven travel packing tips to help every traveler stay organized and confident from takeoff to touchdown."
