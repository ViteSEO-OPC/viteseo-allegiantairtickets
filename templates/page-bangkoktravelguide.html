Hydrate, rest in shaded parks, and use air-conditioned shopping centers to cool down.\n\n<span style='color: #FD593C; font-weight: bold;'>Savor Local Flavors</span>\nBangkok’s street food scene is legendary. Enjoy pad thai, mango sticky rice, and satay at bustling markets such as Yaowarat (Chinatown) and Ratchada. Sometimes, the best meals come from a humble roadside cart.\n\n<span style='color: #FD593C; font-weight: bold;'>Respect Local Culture</span>\nDress modestly for temple visits (shoulders and knees covered), remove shoes when entering sacred spaces, and greet locals with a wai.
